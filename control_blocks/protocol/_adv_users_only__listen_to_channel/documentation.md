A `Listen to Channel` operation listens for items to be generated by the `Send to Channel` operation. The **channel** is set by the **Channel** input parameter. The Sample and the Channel between `Listen to Channel` and `Send to Channel` must be the same for the operations to talk to each other. 

The selection method when multiple items are available is available in the **Selection Method** input parameter.

Use in conjunction with `Wait for All` to synchronize all items.
