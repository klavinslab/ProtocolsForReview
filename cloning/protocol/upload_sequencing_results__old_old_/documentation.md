*Send to Sequencing* => **Upload Sequencing Results** => *Make Glycerol Stock*

1. Upload the sequencing results
2. Verify whether the sequence is correct
    - If the sequence is verified, the overnight culture proceeds to *Make Glycerol Stock* and the plate is thrown out
    - If the sequence is incorrect, the overnight culture and plasmid stock are thrown out
    - If resequencing is indicated, everything is kept, and nothing happens automatically
