Orders a primer.

This protocol takes in a parameter denoting the urgency of this order and then
instructs the technician to create an IDT DNA oligos order, and then outputs a primer. 
IDT charges extra for shipping if primer orders are below $50. If you input "yes" for "Urgent?", the primer will be 
ordered whether or not there are extra shipping costs associated with it. If you input "no" for "Urgent?", the primer will 
only be ordered when no extra shipping costs will be incurred.
