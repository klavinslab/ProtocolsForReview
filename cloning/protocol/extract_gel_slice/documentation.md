Extracts a gel fragment from a gel.

A gel, after gel electrophoresis has been run, is imaged, and the technician uploads both the gel image and verifies whether or not the fragment matches the expected size. If the fragment is the correct length, the fragment is extracted from the gel; if it isn't, the operation errors out and the fragment is thrown out.

Ran after **Run Gel** and is a precursor to **Make PCR Fragment**.
