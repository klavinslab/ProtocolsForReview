Runs a selected gel through gel electrophoresis.

A 50 mL 1 percent Agarose Gel is loaded with the input samples in preparation for gel electrophoresis. 
The gel is then run at 100 Volts for 40 minutes. This operation type creates "Pour Gel" and
"Extract Fragment" operation associations for later use.

Ran after *Pour Gel* and is a precursor to *Extract Fragment*.
