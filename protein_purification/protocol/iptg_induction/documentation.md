The objective of this protocol is to use IPTG to induce the expression of a protein of interest.

- Workflow:
  - Make Overexpression > *IPTG Induction* > Harvest Cell
- Steps:
  - [01] Retrieve the 450 mL cell culture from 37°C shaker.
  - [02] Reserve 1 mL of cell culture to a 1.5 mL tube.
  - [03] Add IPTG to the 450 mL cell culture and return it to 37°C shaker.
  - [04] Incubate the cell culture for 4 hours.
  - [05] While cells incubate, measure and record OD600 value of the 1 mL reserved cell culture.
  - [06] Spin down cell and store the cell pellet at -20°C.
