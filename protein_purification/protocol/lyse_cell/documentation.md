The objective of this protocol is to lyse cell by a sonicator and then spin the sample to collet supernatant for applying to a packed column.

- Workflow:
  - Column Packing > *Lyse cell* > His-tagged Purification
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab cell pellet from -80Â°C freezer and thaw it on ice.
  - [02] Prepare lysis buffer.
  - [03] Suspend cell pellet in lysis buffer and incubate for 20 minutes on ice.
  - [04] Lyse cell by a sonicator.
  - [05] Spin down cell with a high speed centrifuge.
  - [06] Keep supernatant and discard the cell pellet.
