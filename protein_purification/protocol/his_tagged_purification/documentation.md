The objective of this protocol is to capture a target protein by using its binding capacity to Ni-NTA resin.

- Workflow:
  - Lyse cell > *His-tagged Purification* > Concentrate Protein 
- Steps:
  - [01] Prepare wash buffer and elution buffer.
  - [02] Remove cell particles from the sample by loading sample to an empty column and passing through an 30 Âµm filter in the column.
  - [03] Apply sample to the packed column.
  - [04] Wash the column by wash buffer.
  - [05] Elute protein sample by elution buffer.
