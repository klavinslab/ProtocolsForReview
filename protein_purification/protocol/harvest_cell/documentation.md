The objective of this protocol is to collect cell pellet by a centrifuge.

- Workflow:
  - IPTG induction > *Harvest Cell* > Column Packing 
- Steps:
  - [01] Retrieve the cell culture from 37°C shaker.
  - [02] Reserve 1 mL of cell culture in a 1.5 mL tube.
  - [03] Pour 200 mL cell culture into a 225 mL Falcon tube.
  - [04] Spin down the cell at 4696g for 15 minutes.
  - [05] Remove the tube from the centrifuge and discard supernatant.  
  - [06] Pour all the remaining cell culture to the tube and spin down the cell at 4696g for another 15 minutes.
  - [07] Pour off supernatant and keep the cell pellet at -80°C freezer.
