The objective of this protocol is to spread the transformed cell onto a LB plate with ampicilin for colonies growth.

- Workflow:
  - Heat Shock Transformation > *Plate Transformed Cells* > Check Plate
- Steps:
  - [01] Retrieve the transformed cell from 37°C shaker.
  - [02] Grab the pre-warmed LB+Amp plate.
  - [03] Spin down the transformed cell and discard the supernatant.
  - [04] Resuspend cell in 1 mL of LB.
  - [05] Use sterile beads to plate 100 µl from the transformed aliquot onto the plate. 
  - [06] Incubate the plate at 37°C overnight.
