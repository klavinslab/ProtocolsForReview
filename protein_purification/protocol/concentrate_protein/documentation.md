The objective of this protocol is to lower the imidazole concentration in the protein storage buffer and concentrate protein sample to a higher concentration which both help with increasing protein stability. 

- Workflow:
  - His-tagged Purification > *concentrate protein* > SDS-PAGE Sample Preparation
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab a Centriprep tube and equilibrate the filter with water.
  - [02] Spin for 10 minutes and pour off water
  - [03] Pour the protein elution to the Centriprep tube.
  - [04] centrifuge and collect concentrated protein sample.
  - [05] Measure and record protein concentration.
  - [06] Add glycerol to protein sample for preventing sample from being frozen in -20Â°C.
