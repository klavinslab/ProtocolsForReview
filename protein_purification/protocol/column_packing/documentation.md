The objective of this protocol is to prepare a column packed with Ni-NTA resin and pre-equilibrate with binding buffer.

- Workflow:
  - Harvest Cell > *Column Packing* > Lyse Cell 
- Steps:
  - [01] Prepare binding buffer.
  - [02] Grab a column and attach an adaptor to it.
  - [03] Clamp the column to a support stand.
  - [04] Load Ni-NTA resin into the column.
  - [05] Equilibrate Resin by the binding buffer.
