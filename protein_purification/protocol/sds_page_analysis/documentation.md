The objective of this protocol is to analyze proteins in a sample by electrophoresis. 

- Workflow:
  - SDS-PAGE Gel Casting > *SDS-PAGE Analysis* > Scan Gel
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab the samples which are prepared by the protocol "SDS-PAGE Sample Preparation".
  - [02] Load samples into wells using a loading tip.

  - [03] Attach the lid to the tank and start electrophoresis.
  - [04] Run gel until the protein ladder is fully separated.
  - [05] Remove gel from the glass cassette and wash the gel for three times with clean water.
  - [06] Stain gel with gel staining buffer for 1 hour.
  - [07] Destain gel with clean until the gel matrix background is clear.
