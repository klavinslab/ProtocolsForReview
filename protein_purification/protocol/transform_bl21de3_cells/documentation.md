The objective of this protocol is to heat the competent cell and create pores in bacteria cell membrane for taking up the plasmid DNA.

- Workflow:
  - Send to Sequencing > *Heat Shock Transformation* > Plate Transformed Cells (BL21DE3)
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab a tube of BL21DE3 competent cell and add plasmid DNA to the tube. 
  - [02] Mix well and keep the tube on ice for 30 minutes.
  - [03] Heat the tube at 42°C for exactly 40 seconds and place it on ice for 5 minutes.
  - [04] Pipette 950 µL of LB into the mixture.
  - [05] Incubate in 37°C shaker for 1 hour.
  - [06] Grab a LB+Amp plate and pre-warm it in the incubator.
