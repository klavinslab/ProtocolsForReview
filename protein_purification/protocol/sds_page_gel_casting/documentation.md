The objective of this protocol is to cast a gel for SDS-PAGE analysis.

- Workflow:
  - *SDS-PAGE Gel Casting* > SDS-PAGE Analysis
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab a short plate, spacer plate, casting frame, comb, clamping frame, gel running tank and casting stand with gray foam gasket.
  - [02] Slide two glass plates into the casting frame and engage the presssure cams to secure the glasses in the casting frame.
  - [03] Assemble the casting frame on the casting stand.
  - [04] Load water to the glass cassette sandwich and Check it with leakage.
  - [05] Pour off water and prepare 12% resolving gel solution.
  - [06] Load resolving gel solution into the glass cassette and overlay isopropanol.
  - [07] Wait for 1 hour and pour off isopropanol.
  - [08] Prepare 10% stacking gel solution and Load it to the glass cassette.
  - [09] Insert a comb and wait for 30 minutes.
  - [10] Remove the comb and release glass cassette from the casting frame.
  - [11] Slide the glass cassette into clamping frame and lock it into place.
  - [12] Place the clamping frame assembly into the gel running tank.
  - [13] Prepare running buffer and fill the gel running tank with running buffer.
