The objective of this protocol is to grow the cell culture for making a protein of interest.

- Workflow:
  - Make a Starter > *Make Overexpression* > IPTG induction
- Steps:
  - [01] Label a 2L flask and load 450 mL of LB with ampicilin to the flask.
  - [02] Transfer 10 mL of overnight starter culture into the flask.
  - [03] Grow cell culture in 37C shaker for 2.5 hours.
  - [04] Measure OD600 value and make sure the cell density is in the range of 0.6-1.2.
