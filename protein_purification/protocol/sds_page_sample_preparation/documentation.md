The objective of this protocol is to prepare samples for SDS-PAGE analysis.

- Workflow:
  - Concentrate Protein > *SDS-PAGE Sample Preparation* > SDS-PAGE Analysis
- Steps:
  - [01] Grab all reserved samples: cell pellet before IPTG induction, cell pellet after IPTG induction and concentrated protein sample.
  - [02] Add lysis buffer to first two samples and vortex to mix well.
  - [03] Add sample buffer to all samples.
  - [04] Heat at 95Â°C for 5 minutes.
