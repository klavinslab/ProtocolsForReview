For most plan which runs **Flow Cytometry** operation, a **Cytometer Calibration** operation is required to be in the **plan**. 

*Flow Cytometery operations in a plan will not run until the calibration is run, if they are set up to require calibration.*

**In most cases only one calibration should be done per plan**
