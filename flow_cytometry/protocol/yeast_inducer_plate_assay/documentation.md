This Operation Type will take a yeast strain input and prepare a 10-part  inducer series (0 - 100 nM for Beta-estradiol, 0 - 10 uM for coronatine). The maximum number of input strains is 8. 

Timing based on data from bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu, and allowing for the mechanism of beta-estradiol induced activation of a transcription factor producing a protein reporter. 
90 minute incubation = doubling time for S. cerevisiae in YPAD medium. 
2 sets of transcription and translation:
Median Transcription rate per gene in budding yeast = 8 minutes
Translation for a 1000 amino acid protein = maximum 1000 seconds = 17 minutes 
==> 8 + 17 + 8 + 17 to allow for transcription and translation  = 50 minutes.
Double this to allow time for the system to reach a steady state ==> 100 minutes
