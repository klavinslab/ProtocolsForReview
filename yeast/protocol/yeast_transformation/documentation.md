Yeast Transformation
===

This operation will take genetic material of some kind and transform it into a given strain of competent yeast cells. 
You will be left with a plate of the transformed strain, plated on whichever marker was required by the transformant.

NOTE: inputing an undigested plasmid will result in the plasmid itself being transformed, rather than its digest
A plasmid can be digested before transformation using the plasmid digest operation on the plasmid before wiring it into this one.

If the Transformed yeast cell will be plated on antbiotics, then additional steps are required after the transformation finishes. In this case, this operation will create an overnight, which must then be wired into a Yeast Antibiotic plating operation.
