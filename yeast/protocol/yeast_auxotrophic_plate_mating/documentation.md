Mates two haploid strains directly onto an auxotrophic selective plate to produce a diploid. It is the responsibility of the user to correctly set the integrated markers so that the diploid is selected onto the resulting plate.

This operation will error if:
1. the output sample has less than two integrated markers, the operation will error
2. the selective plates are not in stock
3. if there are any antibiotic markers for the output strain (Please use `Yeast Mating` protocol, which will use 6 hour outgrowth before plating onto antibiotics)
