# PcrBatching uses a nearest neighbor chain algorithm to 
# batch pcr operations with their nearest neighbors by extension time until
# CYCLER_COUNT groups remain. 
# These groups are marked by the maximum extension they contain.
# Then, for each thermocycler group, the operations within that group
# are clustered again with a nearest neighbor chain algorithm by temperature, 
# that refuses to make temp groups of larger than COLUMN_COUNT
# until ROW_COUNT temp groups remain.
# each row-grouping is marked with its average temperature.
# range of temp gradient is determined by the highest and lowest
# temp groups. Groups are placed into the rows that have nearest
# temperature to their average, rounding up always.
