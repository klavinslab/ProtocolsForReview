Step 1 in preparation of yeast DNA library samples for NGS. 
Full flow is:
1. Store concentrated  sample in Zymoprep Solution 1, in -80
2. Zymoprep sample and clean
3. Exonuclease digestion and purification of sample
4. qPCR to amplify, clean up, using pETCON adapters 
5. qPCR to amplify and add illumina adapters
