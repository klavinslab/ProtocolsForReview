This protocol does the following:

1) Locates or creates a fresh PhiX 4nM aliquot 
2) Pools the input libraries (according to the pooling algorithm defined in the protocol). All inputs in an iput array are pooled to 1 output library.
3) Denatures the pooled library and PhiX
4) Dilutes the pooled library and PhiX
5) Adds a percentage of PhiX to the pooled library

Ater this, pooled library sample is ready to be loaded on Illumina sequencer.
